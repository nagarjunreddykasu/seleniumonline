		Collection (i)
		
		
List(i)												Set(i)		

ArrayList	LinkedList	Vector
						Stack


ArrayList(C):
-------------
Heterogeneous objects are allowed (different types of data)
It is possible to insert NULL objects
Duplicate objects are allowed
Insertion order is preserved
data structure is grow-able array
We can retrieve the data from ArrayList by using cursors: Iterator and ListIterator

LinkedList(C):
--------------
Heterogeneous objects are allowed (different types of data)
It is possible to insert NULL objects
Duplicate objects are allowed
Insertion order is preserved
data structure is double linked list
We can retrieve the data from LinkedList by using cursors: Iterator and ListIterator

Vector(C):
----------
Heterogeneous objects are allowed (different types of data)
It is possible to insert NULL objects
Duplicate objects are allowed
Insertion order is preserved
data structure is resizable array
We can retrieve the data from Vector by using cursors: Enumeration, Iterator and ListIterator


Set(i):
---------
Heterogeneous objects are allowed (different types of data)
Duplicate objects are NOT allowed
It is possible to insert only one NULL object. because duplicate objects are not allowed.
Insertion order is NOT preserved. but in TreeSet, objects will be retrieved in ascending order.
We can retrieve the data from Set implemented classes by using cursor: Iterator

						Set(i)

HashSet(C)							SortedSet(i)

LinkedHashSet(C)					NavigableSet(i)
	
									TreeSet(C)
