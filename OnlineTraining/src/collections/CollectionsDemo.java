		Collection (i)
		
		
List(i)												Set(i)		

ArrayList	LinkedList	Vector
						Stack


ArrayList(C):
-------------
Heterogeneous objects are allowed (different types of data)
It is possible to insert NULL objects
Duplicate objects are allowed
Insertion order is preserved
data structure is grow-able array
We can retrieve the data from ArrayList by using cursors: Iterator and ListIterator

LinkedList(C):
--------------
Heterogeneous objects are allowed (different types of data)
It is possible to insert NULL objects
Duplicate objects are allowed
Insertion order is preserved
data structure is double linked list
We can retrieve the data from LinkedList by using cursors: Iterator and ListIterator

Vector(C):
----------
Heterogeneous objects are allowed (different types of data)
It is possible to insert NULL objects
Duplicate objects are allowed
Insertion order is preserved
data structure is resizable array
We can retrieve the data from Vector by using cursors: Enumeration, Iterator and ListIterator


Set(i):
---------


						Set(i)

HashSet(C)							SortedSet(i)

LinkedHashSet(C)					NavigableSet(i)
	
									TreeSet(C)
									
									
HashSet:
--------
Heterogeneous objects are allowed (different types of data)
Duplicate objects are NOT allowed
It is possible to insert only one NULL object. because duplicate objects are not allowed.
Insertion order is NOT preserved.
We can retrieve the data from Set implemented classes by using cursor: Iterator
Data structure is HashTable

LinkedHashSet(C):
-----------------
LinkedHashSet is child class of HashSet.
Heterogeneous objects are allowed (different types of data).
Duplicate objects are NOT allowed.
It is possible to insert only one NULL object. because duplicate objects are not allowed.
Insertion order is preserved.
We can retrieve the data from Set implemented classes by using cursor: Iterator
Data Structures are LinkedList and HashTable.

TreeSet(C):
-----------
Heterogeneous objects are allowed (different types of data).
Duplicate objects are NOT allowed.
NULL insertion is NOT possible.
Insertion order is NOT preserved and it sorts elements in ascending order.
We can retrieve the data from Set implemented classes by using cursor: Iterator
Data Structures are LinkedList and HashTable.
